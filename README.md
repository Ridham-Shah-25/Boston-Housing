# Boston-Housing
# Overview of Efforts
In this project, I have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.I Have-
* Imported The Relevant Libraries
* Created a Pandas Dataframe,Explored The Dataset and added another value to store Target attribute in it
* Created a Heatmap to find correlation between different features and labels
* Normalized The Dataset
* Decided The Features to be used for prediction referring the Heatmap and trained the model
* Trained and Tested 3 Machine Learning Models-
  * Linear Regression
  * SVM Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
* Displayed The R2 Scores for all 3 Models
# Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you've come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.
# Highlights
This project is designed to get acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Before being expected to use many of the available algorithms in the sklearn library, it will be helpful to first practice analyzing and interpreting the performance of your model.

Things I have learned by completing this project:

* How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
* How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
* How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
* How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.
# Deciding Features to be used for Training the Model
I created a Heatmap to find the correlation between different features and labels.
