# Boston-Housing
# Overview of Efforts
In this project, I have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.I Have-
* Imported The Relevant Libraries
* Created a Pandas Dataframe,Explored The Dataset and added another value to store Target attribute in it
* Created a Heatmap to find correlation between different features and labels
* Normalized The Dataset
* Decided The Features to be used for prediction referring the Heatmap and trained the model
* Trained and Tested 3 Machine Learning Models-
  * Linear Regression
  * SVM Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
*Displayed The R2 Scores for all 3 Models
# Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you've come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.
